 * What a way somebody actually took would cost them, if they could take it at all.

 * A reach says where a piece could end up; this says whether the way it went to get there was
 * one it could have walked. The two differ wherever the cheapest way round is not the way the
 * hand went: a piece dragged straight over a wall lands somewhere it could have reached the
 * long way about, and only the way it went shows that it did not go the long way about.
 *
 * Standing still costs nothing. A step that is not onto a neighbour, or onto ground nobody may
 * enter, makes the whole way unwalkable rather than merely dear.
