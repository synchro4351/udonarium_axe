/**
 * What this particular screen measures, and whether it is being used as a tabletop right now.
 *
 * None of it is written down. The measurement describes the glass in front of this browser, and
 * nothing identifies a screen well enough to know it is the same one next time - carrying it to
 * an external display would make it a lie. Real size and the lock are states rather than
 * settings, and a state that outlives the session comes back in a room where it makes no sense.
 *
 * How wide a square is meant to measure is not held here but alongside, in this seat's own
 * display settings: it is the one part of real size that is worth keeping between sessions,
 * and it belongs to the screen the miniatures are standing on rather than to the room.
