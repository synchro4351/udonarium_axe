 * table, its size, the corner it is dragged by, the button that shuts it — has nothing left
 * to describe, and a second set of window controls inside a window is only confusing. What
 * the panel's content put in the bar is left alone: those work on what it is showing, not on
 * the frame, and are the same use here as anywhere.
 *
 * Only the window's own panel is told this. A panel opened from it stands in the window as it
