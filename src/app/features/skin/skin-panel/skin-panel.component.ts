/**
 * The whole skin, shown at the size it is actually read at.
 *
 * Three things have to hold at once for this to be worth opening. The preview has to stay
 * on screen while the sliders are being dragged, so it is stuck to the top of the panel
 * rather than scrolling away above the controls. A skin has to be viewable without being
 * put on, so hovering a swatch shows it here and only a click commits. And the app behind
 * the panel is the truest preview there is, so choosing repaints it at once — which is
 * only safe because what the seat was wearing when the panel opened can be put back.
